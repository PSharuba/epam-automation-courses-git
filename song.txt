You let the poison running through your veins
You're addicted to the pain and the shame
I'm chasing the same game every day
Who don't know your bullshit and your vanity
Blind decisions, no regrets
A bittersweet of toxic sweat
You take my pride, taking chances on my life
Never insist, but in time
You just wait, you're gonna say my name
Break this bind, cut my losses
No more carrying all your crosses, come in time
You just wait, you're gonna say my name
Oh you're gonna say my name
A normal situation in disguise
Dragging me through your self inflicted lies
Too bad you're never gonna win this game
Your misery's your only friend and you're to blame
Blind decisions, no regrets
A bittersweet of toxic sweat
====================================
You take my pride, taking chances on my life
Never insist, but in time
You just wait, you're gonna say my name
Break this bind, cut my losses
No more carrying all your crosses, come in time
You just wait, you're gonna say my name
Oh, you're gonna say my name
Bringing everybody down, down, down
You turn around
Into the same games, just hit it upside down
Another go-around, you're gonna say my name
It's gonna come around
Yeah, bringing everybody down, down, down
and turn around
Into the same games, just hit it upside down
Another go-around, you're gonna say my name
You're gonna say my name, say my name
You take my pride, taking chances on my life
Never insist, but in time
You just wait, you're gonna say my name
Break this bind, cut my losses
No more carrying all your crosses, come in time
You just wait, you're gonna say my name
Oh, bitch, say my name
You know you're gonna say my name
Oh, say my name
